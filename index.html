        <div >
          <p>Auto theft is an issue that has been plaguing Canadians more and more as time moves on. In 2022 alone 
            more than 105,000 vehicles were stolen across Canada, and in 2023 Canada's private auto insurers 
            paid out $1.5 billion dollars in theft claims, a 254% increase since 2018.  This is the second 
            year in a row that theft claims have totaled more than $1 billion. To put this into greater perspective, 
            between 2018 and 2021, auto theft claims cost Canadians an average of $556 million annually. In Ontario alone, 
            auto theft claims costs increased by 524% between 2018 and 2023, surpassing $1 billion for the first time in 2023. 
            This trend shows that unless something is done to address the issue it will only continue to get worse in the future.

        <div >
          <p>
            So, what would be the solution to this national crisis of car theft? Some simple options are to make sure your car 
            doors are locked at night or to ensure that your windows are closed whenever you leave your car. We, however, are 
            proposing a different solution, one that holds the federal government responsible for this international issue. Our 
            proposal is to implement a national database for all vehicle drivers across Canada operating at the federal level. 
            Our database will store pertinent vehicle and driver information as well as any theft reports related to each vehicle 
            in our database. The aim is to provide provincial and municipal governments with the proper tools to track down car 
            thieves by giving them important information about every vehicle currently operating on Canadas roadways.

        <h2 id="info-title">Project Scope</h2>
        
        <div >
          <p>
            To go more in depth as to the scope of this project, in terms of driver information, our database will store their full name, 
            address, and most importantly the province that they reside in. In terms of vehicle information, it will store information 
            on vehicles such as make, model, vin number and license plate number. For theft reporting it will store information based 
            on when the incident occurred, the last known address of the vehicle, the status of the theft report, and the province in 
            which the report was issued. Our aim is to integrate the database with law enforcement in order to get real time reports of 
            thefts that occur.

        <h2 id="info-title">Requirements/ Assumptions</h2>
        <div >
          <p>
            Our technical requirements would involve the ability to secure data storage with encryption to protect sensitive information. 
            It would also require national accessibility across all provinces and territories with compatibility for municipal and 
            provincial systems. We also intend to implement user roles for different officials in terms of government, law enforcement, 
            insurers, and citizens to grant access on varying levels. It would be assumed that this would be a legal practice and that all 
            Canadian citizens would be mandated to participate by law. It is also based off the assumption that data sharing across 
            provinces is legally feasible and would be supported by government policies.
